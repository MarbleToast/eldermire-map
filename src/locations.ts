    4354: "Perelline (Dungeon)", // A large tree covered in amber blossoms, surrounded by a thick stake wall. The oak door in the stake wall has an inscription in ancient Elvish: "Come now, bring ye offerings of bushels of amber, and this door to Perelline shall swing wide." Below it is a carved mural of two elves holding a wooden vase, which has an opening for flowers. This is asking for amber blossoms to be picked from the fields nearby. Inside, Ilessnya Pellenior, demi-goddess and former Queen of Arvenalora can be found, drunk and addicted to eating the flowers. She asks for death

    4393: "Wolf Spirit Cave (Mini-Dungeon)", // A cave filled with wolves with glowing green eyes. When a wolf is killed, a ghostly force seems to peel from their bodies, sucked into the cave. At the core is a Wolf Spirit Swarm that coalesces around the skeletal remains of a large wolf, with a small necklace in its stomach. This amulet was given by the Witch of Módar Run to another adventurer, in order to collect and bring her the souls of the dead, before he was killed and eaten by the wolf pack.

    4098: "Fort Maydew (FT)", // A crumbling fortress that once served as a bastion against the encroaching darkness, the human-built Fort Maydew now stands as a somber reminder of the Knots' fall from grace. Its stone walls are marred by creeping vines and the decay of time. The fort's courtyard, once a lively training ground, is now overrun by thorns and twisted vegetation. Miremals have taken up the bulwark, under the direction of an Ogre Howdah. The Ogre has been trying to activate a gate at the centre of the fort, which is a Stepsend. He also has a load of goblin scribblings on mud tablets which detail a scout report on Fort Nirunna, and another on the Heretic's Graveyard.

    3176: "Small Hut", // The hut of the Witch of Módar Run. Originally an elven traitor working with the illithid, she was tried by the Court of Ilessan, and imprisoned. Her illithid mutations, along with Velkoryanaz's corruption affecting her and the region, allowed her to escape, but Ilessnya Pellenior's ward prevents her from doing what she truely wants - destroying Meridian, which she still believes to be inhabited by elves. She sells trinkets and such, in exchange for favours. She is, however, always manouevering her gullable customers, both through the favours she asks for and the trinkets she gives them, to escape the ward.

    2380: "Spire of Hope (Dungeon)", // The Cragriver is blocked shut by a dam with a thick steel chain and pulley system connected to a tower fort. This fort, along with the area around it, seem to have warded off the corruption that has befallen so much of the rest of the surroundings. The grass is verdant, the trees are straight and sturdy, the sound of birdsong and smell of roses wafts from the courtyard. However, this is a lamia den, and is merely an illusion created by Matriarch Zzal. The jackalweres that can be found in Módar Run and on the banks on the sound end of the Cragriver are under her thrall, and will kidnap unweary travellers to be taken to the fort dungeons.

The former mine owner, Ethlan Connolly, is eager to see the nest blown up to open the mine again, whereas the moonweavers will move if they can gather enough spider silk from Eldermire to complete a new nest nearby. Taking too long will result in Connolly using his former wealth to print posters petitioning the reopening of the mine, and dragging the 'limp-minded fools that choose foul nature over Meridian'. Moonweavers will hint that the other side of the mountain is too hot for them to live.
