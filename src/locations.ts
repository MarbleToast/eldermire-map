At the core is a Wolf Spirit Swarm that coalesces around the skeletal remains of a large wolf, with a small necklace in its stomach. This amulet was given by the Witch of Módar Run to another adventurer, in order to collect and bring her the souls of the dead, before he was killed and eaten by the wolf pack.

Her illithid mutations, along with Velkoryanaz's corruption affecting her and the region, allowed her to escape, but Ilessnya Pellenior's ward prevents her from doing what she truely wants - destroying Meridian, which she still believes to be inhabited by elves. She sells trinkets and such, in exchange for favours. She is, however, always manouevering her gullable customers, both through the favours she asks for and the trinkets she gives them, to escape the ward.

The former mine owner, Ethlan Connolly, is eager to see the nest blown up to open the mine again, whereas the moonweavers will move if they can gather enough spider silk from Eldermire to complete a new nest nearby. Taking too long will result in Connolly using his former wealth to print posters petitioning the reopening of the mine, and dragging the 'limp-minded fools that choose foul nature over Meridian'. Moonweavers will hint that the other side of the mountain is too hot for them to live.
